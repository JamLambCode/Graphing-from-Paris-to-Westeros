# Graphing-from-Paris-to-Westeros

## Description
This project was a headfirst dive into different methods of data visualization and further algorithms to simplify our representations. First, data from the Paris train system is mapped to have an easy reference for visualization. Then, the data is presented to effectively communicated lines, distances, etc. at a single glance. Using techniques learned from this exploration, a more complicated data set from Game of Thrones is analyzed. Characters are represented as Nodes and both **Importance by degree** and **Betweeness Centrality** are used to breakdown hidden structures in our data. Then, using the **Girvan Newman algorithm**, we see how our observations change when splitting our graphed network into seperate communities.

## What I Learned
* The effectiveness of different data visualization techniques in simplifying complex information.
* The application of network analysis algorithms in revealing underlying structures in data.
* How to balance technical rigor with narrative understanding, especially in the context of a rich, layered story like Game of Thrones.

## How to Run
Either open file in **Jupyter notebook** or **Google Colab**. Cells should then be run chronologically; text is provided with each cell for further explonation of the method used.
